# Party People

## Scenario

At Koderly, our employees attend a lot of events throughout the year, and we need an application to track which events our employees will be attending.
Koderly has started creating an application called PartyPeople. The application is buggy and unfinished, and we need your help to complete it.

### Built With

The PartyPeople application is an ASP.NET Core MVC application, written in C# and targets the .NET 8 Framework. The application uses SQLite for its database and includes the following technologies.

- C#
- .NET 8
- ASP.NET Core
- [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper)
- [FluentValidation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Development for the PartyPeople application relies on the below software:

- Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition, incl. ASP.NET and Web Development

### Build Steps

To build the PartyPeople application, you need to follow the steps below.

1. Clone the repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Coder7894/PartyPeople.git
   ```

2. Open the PartyPeople.sln in Visual Studio

3. Build and Run the Website project in Visual Studio

## Tasks

You only need to spend as much time on the tasks as you feel necessary to demonstrate your capabilities, and you don't need to complete every task.
We estimate that it could take between four and seven hours to complete all tasks if you choose to do so.

To complete the application, you need to carry out the tasks below.

### Task 1

The PartyPeople project does not currently build. Can you help figure out why, and resolve the build issues?

### Task 2

A bug has been reported that updating events is not working as expected. Can you help by debugging the functionality and resolving the issue?

### Answer 2 
The WHERE clause was missing from the SQL meaning that if you update one Event the update will overide every other event in the database table. 


### Task 3

Koderly would like to track which employees are attending which events. Can you extend the PartyPeople application to add this functionality?

### Task 4

Koderly would like to track which drinks should be ordered for employees. Can you extend the functionality to allow each employee to optionally specify a ‘Favourite Drink’?

### Task 5

Koderly would like to track the five most social employees (i.e. employees who have attended the most events). Can you add a widget to the Home screen to display this information?

### Task 6

Koderly would like to track upcoming events which have no attendees registered. Can you add a widget to the Home screen to display this information?
